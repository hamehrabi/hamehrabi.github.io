												<h4>MLOps Project: Drug Discovery - Binary Classification</h4>
												<p>This ML project aimed to predict the permeability of compounds in PAMPA assay using their SMILES strings for binary classification. 18 algorithms, including traditional ML and GNN-ML frameworks like PyG and DeepPurpose, were evaluated using standard metrics. An accurate model was developed to guide drug discovery and development, and an end-to-end ML architecture was created, incorporating model training, testing, and operationalization. Technologies used included Python, shell scripting, AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, FastAPI, S3 bucket, and Jenkins for CI-CD. Endpoint monitoring and infrastructure were included for the ADMET_PAMPA_NCATS dataset.</p>

												<h4>MLOps Project: Red wine quality Classification + AWS Sagemaker integration</h4>
												<p>This project aims to classify the quality of Red Wine using physicochemical and sensory variables. The datasets include scores between 0 and 10 for normal, excellent, or poor wine quality. An end-to-end MLOps pipeline will be deployed using AWS for S3 storage, mlflow for experiment tracking, and Terraform for infrastructure deployment. The pipeline will include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.</p>

												<h4>DVC NLP Project: An end-to-end NLP binary sentiment classification + CI/CD/CT</h4>
												<p>This project is an LSTM-based text classification system that utilizes the IMDB dataset, which consists of 50K movie reviews for natural language processing. The dataset is suitable for binary sentiment classification and contains substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets, with 25,000 reviews provided for training and 25,000 for testing. The project's primary goal is to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms. Additionally, the project uses Flask and Gunicorn as an endpoint and has been developed using microservice architecture, making it an end-to-end project.</p>
